# Waze_ADA_Project
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely.
Collaborate with Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. In your role, you will analyze user data and develop a machine learning model that predicts user churn. 
This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

ASSIGNMENTS:
1. Waze is asking for a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within this project.
   Tasks: Organize project tasks into milestones, Classify tasks using the PACE workflow, Identify relevant stakeholders.
2. Build a dataframe for the churn data. After the dataframe is complete, Organize the data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on your progress and insights.
   Tasks: Build a dataframe for the churn dataset, Examine data type of each column, Gather descriptive statistics.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis on data for the churn project. Use tools to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.
   Tasks: EDA and cleaning, Select and build visualization(s) type(Create plots to visualize variables and relationships between variables), Share your results with the data team.
4. Conduct hypothesis testing on the data for the churn data. The data team has asked you to investigate Waze's dataset to determine which hypothesis testing method best serves the data and the churn project.
   Tasks: Explore the project data, Implement a hypothesis test, Communicate insights with stakeholders within Waze.
5. Create a regression model for the churn project. Determine the type of regression model that is needed and develop one using Waze's churn project data.
   Tasks: Determine the correct modeling approach, Build a regression model, Finish checking model assumptions, Evaluate the model, Interpret model results and summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within Waze.
6. Create the final machine learning model for the churn project which include feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
   Tasks: Model building, Model evaluation, Summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within Waze.
